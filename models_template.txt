# Add the model names you want to use.
# They will appear in the 'Optional_model' dropdown in the Advanced Prompt Enhancer.
# This applies to both local or remote services that require you to pass a model name.
# *****************
# Enter each model name on a new line after this comment section.
# Optionally, you can preface each model name with the name of the service it applies to, followed by two colons.
# The models will be sorted alphabetically.
# The service name is for your reference only; the model name sent to the service will be the part that appears after the two colons.
# If you don't include a service name, the model name will be presented exactly as you enter it.
# Be sure to spell the model names exactly as they appear in the service.
# After adding or removing model names and saving this file, you'll need to restart ComfyUI to see the changes in the app.
