# Add the model names you want use. 
# They will appear in the 'Optional_model' field pulldown in Advanced Prompt Enhancer.
# This for local or remote services that require you to pass a model name.
# *****************
# Put each model name on a new line beginning after this comment section.
# Optionally you can preface each model name with the name of the service it applies to, followed by two colons.
# The models will be sorted alphabetically.  
# The service name is for your benefit, the model name presented to the service will be the name that appears after the two colons. 
# If you don't include a service name the model name will be presented as it appears.
# Be sure to spell the model names exactly as they appear in the service.
# After you enter or remove model names and save this file, you'll need to reboot ComfyUI to see them in the app.
